# Oh Joy! Another JVM Language

When you manage large projects with a lot of developers, one of the considerations when picking technologies is how well your least-skilled developers will be able
to master them. That's right, I said "least-skilled". Therefore when the whole polyglot thing became fashionable and a new JVM language was being created every other week,
I had to weigh each request to try a new language against how badly it would be put to use. And should I have to replace people!! It's already hard enough trying to hire
competent Java developers... assembling an army of Clojure/Scala/whatever devs would be impossible.

So when Kotlin came about, I didn't even bother to look into it as I had no need for another language in my current technology stack.

But times are a changin'.

# How Do You Make a Kotlin Dev? Hire a Java Programmer

A few years ago I watched a Silicon Valley VC give a talk on a startup he was guiding, and they had a challenge of finding Go programmers at a time when Go programmers
were few and far between. According to him, learning Go was fairly natural for seasoned Java developers. I found that especially interesting given that the only thing
the two languages seem to have in common is a love of curly braces.

But I couldn't fault his basic premise: find something that Java developers can readily learn because there are a lot of Java developers out there.

And the same holds true if you have an existing bank of Java developers. If you want to transition them to a new stack or new way, find something they can easily learn.

# Oh Joy! Functional Java

Perhaps the big reason for being excited about Kotlin isn't necessarily the language itself but rather a focus on functional programming for which the industry is now
moving toward. And while Java has functional features, they are far from a joy to use. So Kotlin, having less syntactic ceremony, makes functional programming on the
JVM easier while still remaining very commpatible with existing Java code.

Onward...
