If you have not seen the interview of Linus Torvalds at TED from February, I
highly recommend it. He's changed the face of modern computing twice. His
code runs in billions of devices (you might be reading this on one right now),
and millions of software developers around the world manage their code thanks
to his creation of Git. And yet, he's a humble, gracious and down-to-earth man.
